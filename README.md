# 🍽️ Swiggy Sales Analysis | SQL + Power BI (DirectQuery)

## Business Problem Definition (BPD)

Food delivery platforms like Swiggy generate massive volumes of transactional data across cities, restaurants, and dishes. However, without proper analysis, it is difficult to extract meaningful insights.

### Key Business Questions

* Which cities generate the highest revenue and orders?
* What are the most popular dishes and food categories (Veg vs Non-Veg)?
* Which restaurants perform best based on sales and ratings?
* How do sales and orders trend over time?
* What drives customer satisfaction (ratings)?


## Objective

To build an end-to-end data analytics solution that:

* Transforms raw data into a **Star Schema**
* Establishes relationships using **SQL Server**
* Performs analytical queries
* Builds an **interactive Power BI dashboard (DirectQuery)**
* Enables data-driven decision making


## Solution Approach

To address the business problem, the following solution was implemented:

### 1. Data Preparation (SQL Server)

* Imported raw data into SQL Server using flat file import
* Cleaned and structured the dataset
* Renamed columns for consistency (`food_id → dish_id`)


### 2. Data Modeling (Star Schema)

* Designed a **Fact-Dimension model**
* Created:

  * `fact_orders` (transaction data)
  * `dim_date`, `dim_dish`, `dim_restaurant`, `dim_location`
* Established relationships using **Primary Keys & Foreign Keys**


### 3. Data Validation

* Performed SQL joins to validate relationships
* Ensured referential integrity across all tables

### 4. SQL-Based Analysis

* Calculated KPIs:

  * Total Revenue
  * Total Orders
  * Average Rating
* Performed:

  * City-level analysis
  * Restaurant performance analysis
  * Time-based trend analysis


### 5. Power BI Integration (DirectQuery)

* Connected SQL Server to Power BI using **DirectQuery mode**
* Ensured real-time data connectivity
* Built relationships in Power BI model view


### 6. Dashboard Development

* Created interactive visuals:

  * KPI Cards (Sales, Orders, Ratings)
  * Bar Charts (Top Restaurants, Top Dishes)
  * Line Chart (Monthly Trend)
  * Map (City-wise Sales)
  * Pie Chart (Veg vs Non-Veg)


### 7. DAX Calculations

* Created custom calculated column for food classification:

```DAX
Food Type =
VAR dish = LOWER(dim_dish[dish_name])
RETURN
IF (
    CONTAINSSTRING(dish, "chicken") ||
    CONTAINSSTRING(dish, "egg") ||
    CONTAINSSTRING(dish, "fish") ||
    CONTAINSSTRING(dish, "mutton") ||
    CONTAINSSTRING(dish, "prawn") ||
    CONTAINSSTRING(dish, "biryani") ||
    CONTAINSSTRING(dish, "kabab") ||
    CONTAINSSTRING(dish, "kebab") ||
    CONTAINSSTRING(dish, "non-veg") ||
    CONTAINSSTRING(dish, "non veg"),
    "Non-Veg",
    "Veg"
)
```


## Data Model (Star Schema)

### Fact Table

* `fact_orders`

### Dimension Tables

* `dim_date`
* `dim_dish`
* `dim_restaurant`
* `dim_location`

###  Relationships

* fact_orders → dim_date
* fact_orders → dim_dish
* fact_orders → dim_restaurant
* fact_orders → dim_location

✔ Built using **Primary Key & Foreign Key constraints**
✔ Optimized for analytics
